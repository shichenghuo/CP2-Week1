*Data* | *Render* | *Simulation* | *Event*
------------|------------|------------|------------
Option1: Position of the people | Colors | Blinking in different frequency | People walk through each circle
Option2: The pressure created by person | Blink | Color change |
The speed of passing each circle |Sound|Different pattern of lighting|

#### Observation
The lighting circle will change in sequence when people pass by each circle. The speed might have a relationship with the frequency of blinking. The circle channel also has different lighting patterns changes over time.

*Data* | *Render* | *Simulation* | *Event*
------------|------------|------------|------------
The position of the object in the setting matrix | Color code | Back to the default position | The obeject moves in the space
The shape of the object in 3 dementional| Cubes'action (moving/modeling)| Cubes arrangement changing | User moving the indicator
Livirary of landcapes models|Color fill of the object|Different pattern of lighting|
The changing of other cubes on the surface|||

#### Observation
The project shows a wild use of the cube system. It mainly sensed the movement of the object in the heat space or the object movement on the surface and reacted to the action.The cubes can simulate the outline of the object and fill it with color. The system can also be used as a 3D interface.
